      The residents of Meigs County, Ohio, live beneath the towering smokestacks
      of four coal-fired power plants. A fifth plant has been proposed, the
      latest salvo in a battle over the way the U.S. gets electricity.

      Since 2001, U.S. energy companies have proposed more than 150 new coal
      plants. But a loose network of environmental activists, aided by uncertain
      economic conditions, has forced plans for more than 100 of the plants to
      be abandoned. Dozens more are clogged up in the court systems. One such
      coal fight is unfolding in Meigs County, Ohio, which is already surrounded
      by four coal-fired power plants.
      <a href="www.amp-ohio.org/">American Municipal Power</a> has proposed
      building a new Meigs County coal plant, slated to begin construction late
      this year or in early 2010. The following information provides background
      to explain why coal plants are at the center of a national debate over
      energy production and consumption.

        Nearly 50 percent of U.S. electricity
        <a href="www.eia.doe.gov/basics/quickelectric.html">comes from coal</a>.
        Coal-fired power plants burn coal to generate steam, which is used to
        turn the turbines of an electrical generator. The U.S. has one of the
        largest coal reserves in the world and burns it at about
        <a href="www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c01.html">600 plants</a>
        across the nation. Generating electricity from coal is common in the

        has advocated a moratorium on building new coal plants until technology
        is developed to prevent the carbon dioxide from escaping into the
        atmosphere. Hansen has
        <a href="www.alternet.org/environment/50795">warned</a> that continuing
        to release carbon dioxide at current rates – even just for the next 10
        years – will create “a different planet – one without sea ice in the
        Arctic; with worldwide, repeated coastal tragedies associated with
        storms and a continuously rising sea level.” The proposed American
        Municipal Power plant in Meigs County would release an estimated 5.5
        million tons of carbon dioxide annually, according to CARMA, a nonprofit
        group.

        have been proposed for the region, although at least some of those plans
        appear to be on hold. Meanwhile, Meigs County is one of the poorest
        counties in Ohio, according to 2000 U.S. Census data. Elisa Young, a
        Meigs County resident who has organized opposition to the new plant,
        argues that poverty reduces local opposition to the coal industry. “When
        you have an economy that's entirely wrapped around coal, you can't speak
        out about it,” she says.

      Some Meigs County residents are concerned about the health effects of coal
      plants. Why?
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p class="bod">
        In 2007, the four existing coal plants near Meigs County released
        millions of pounds of toxic chemicals, including arsenic, chromium,
        manganese, mercury, sulfuric acid aerosols and selenium, according to
        the Environmental Protection Agency. Each of these chemicals has been
        linked to human health problems, such as cancer, gastrointestinal
        disorders, impaired motor skills and neurological damage. Kent Carson, a
        spokesperson for American Municipal Power, said the proposed plant will
        use new technology to control pollutants. “This will be the cleanest
        facility of its type in the state,” he said.

    <button class="accordion">
      Can it be proved that the coal plants are responsible for health problems
      in Meigs County?
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p class="bod">
        It can be hard to prove that any one of the chemicals caused health
        problems of a particular individual. “We’re exposed to a soup of
        chemicals,” said Kevin Crist, director of the Center for Air Quality at
        Ohio University. Crist said health problems can be influenced by
        interactions between chemicals, as well as by lifestyle factors. In
        addition, low income – a common characteristic in Meigs County – is
        correlated with health problems. One reason is that poor people are more
        likely to smoke than their wealthier counterparts. More than
        <a href="www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov"
          >30 percent of adult residents of Southeast Ohio smoke</a
        >, compared to only about 25 percent of residents of other Ohio
        counties. Crist said tall smokestacks on the existing plants probably
        disperse most pollutants away from Meigs County. But he said it is
        impossible to know for sure what residents are being exposed to, because
        no agency monitors the county’s air.

      So what do we know about air quality and health in Meigs County?

        An
        <a href="content.usatoday.com/news/nation/environment/smokestack/index"
          >analysis by USA Today</a
        >
        estimated that the air quality at Southern Elementary School in Meigs
        County is worse than the air quality at 97 percent of the nation's
        schools. USA Today identified two of the coal plants near Meigs County
        as major contributors to pollution at the school.  In addition, men in
        Meigs County have the lowest life expectancy among men in any Ohio
        county, according to
        <a href="dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030260.sd001">data</a>

        (women ranked 26th worst of 88 counties).  Meigs County also has the
        highest death rate of any Ohio county for lung and bronchus cancer,
        according to the

      Despite the suspected health effects, wouldn’t a new plant create
      much-needed jobs?
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p class="bod">
        Blue-collar labor is especially important in Meigs County, where fewer
        than 5 percent of adult residents hold college degrees and more than 25
        percent have no high school diploma, according to the Ohio Office of
        Policy, Research and Strategic Planning. In 2007, Meigs County's median
        income was $27,287, about half the national average.  Many Meigs County
        residents support the new plant for the jobs it may bring to the
        community. Construction worker Greg Sheets has testified in favor of the
        plant at public hearings. “My family will benefit by me going up there
        and working,” he said. “If I reached in your pocket and took $200,000
        out of your pocket, would you like it?” he said, referring to the income
        he estimated he could earn during the four years it would take to build
        the plant. But no one can guarantee how many jobs will actually go to
        Meigs County residents or how much they will pay.  “We all know that not
        all the workers are going to come from Meigs County,” said Sheets, the
        construction worker. “They’ll be from all over the country.”

      <p class="bod">
        Before construction can begin on a new coal plant, an energy company
        must receive pollution permits from a state regulatory authority.
        Carson, the American Municipal Power spokesman, said his utility has
        received all the permits it needs and that construction on the plant
        will start in late 2009 or early 2010. Opponents of the plant have
        appealed the plant’s permits. The state of Ohio will allow construction
        to proceed during the appeals process.
